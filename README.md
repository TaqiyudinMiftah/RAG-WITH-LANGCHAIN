### 📘 Repository Description 

**RAG-With-LangChain** is a personal learning project focused on exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **LangChain**.
This repository documents my journey in building and understanding RAG pipelines — from document loading and text preprocessing to vectorization, retrieval, and integration with large language models (LLMs).

The project demonstrates how to combine **retrievers** and **LLMs** to create question-answering system that can reason over external knowledge sources.
It’s designed as a hands-on implementation to deepen my understanding of how RAG works in real-world applications.


### 🧠 Key Topics

* LangChain document loaders and text splitters
* Embedding generation and vector stores (FAISS / ChromaDB)
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline
* Custom prompts and query chains
* Experimentation with local and API-based LLMs

### 🚀 Goal

The main goal of this repository is **to learn and experiment** with the RAG architecture using Python and LangChain, building a foundation for future **AI-powered knowledge systems**.
